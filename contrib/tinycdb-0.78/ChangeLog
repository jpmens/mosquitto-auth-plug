2006-06-29  Michael Tokarev  <mjt@corpit.ru>

	* see debian/changelog file for further changes.

2005-04-18  Michael Tokarev  <mjt@corpit.ru>

	* move cdb_make_find.c content into cdb_make_put.c

	* introduce CDB_PUT_REPLACE0 - zerofill old duplicates

	* allow usage of cdb.h in C++

2005-04-11  Michael Tokarev  <mjt@corpit.ru>

	* do not autogenerate files (cdb.h.in, cdb.3.in etc), but
	  use real files instead (only substituted VERSION and NAME)

	* finally fixed the `!fputs()' condition to be `fputs() < 0'
	  as it should be in cdb.c (misbehaves on *bsd)

	* kill cdbi_t usage in cdb_int.h

	* export _cdb_make_fullwrite() (was ewrite()) and _cdb_make_flush()
	  and use them in cdb_make.c as appropriate

	* almost completely rewrite _cdb_make_find() and friends:
	  - _cdb_make_find() now accepts new parameter, remove (bool), which,
	    if true, indicates all found records should be deleted from the
	    database.
	  - Call _cdb_make_find() with remove=0 from cdb_make_exists()
	  - Call _cdb_make_find() with appropriate arguments from
	    cdb_make_put(), and simplify the latter greatly (was too clumsy
	    anyway)

	* rename `flags' parameter in cdb_make_put() to be `mode' which is
	  more appropriate

	* change #if conditional in nss_cdb.c
	  from __GLIBC__ to __GNU_LIBRARY__

2003-11-04  Michael Tokarev  <mjt@corpit.ru>

	* added cdb_get() routine: tinycdb officially uses mmap.

	* added cdb_{get,read}{data,key}() macros to read and get
	  current data and key.

	* fixed bug in cdb_seek() - incorrect wrap, sometimes
	  cdb_seek()+cdb_bread() may return EIO instead of finding
	  correct record.
	
	* added some tweaks to Makefile to build position-independent
	  libcdb_pic.a and shared libcdb.so libraries.  Note that
	  using libcdb as shared library is probably not a good idea,
	  due to tiny size of the library.

	* added initial nss_cdb module.  Still not well-tested.
	  Probably will not build on non-GNU system.

	* adjusted tests.{ok,sh} for latest cdb utility modifications
	  (-a mode in query by default)

	* Victor Porton (porton at ex-code.com) provided a patch
	  to allow tinycdb to be built on win32 platform (cdb_init.c).
	  Completely untested.

2003-08-13  Michael Tokarev  <mjt@corpit.ru>

	* s/cdbi_t/unsigned/g.  No need to keep this type.

	* changed usage of cdb_findnext(): one need to pass
	  pointer to cdb structure to cdb_findnext() now,
	  and should use cdb_datapos(struct cdb_find *)
	  instead of cdb_datapos(struct cdb *)

	* added cdb_seqinit() and cdb_seqnext() routines for sequential
	  record enumeration

	* addded cdb_dend to the cdb structure: end of data
	  position.  Use that in cdb_seq*().

	* more strict checking: ensure data is within data section,
	  and hash tables are within hash section of a file.

	* cdb_make.c (cdb_make_start): zerofill cdb_make structure
	  to shut valgrind up (writing uninitialized data to file)
	
	* cdb.c (cmode): always open file in RDWR mode to allow
	  duplicate key detection

2002-12-08  Michael Tokarev  <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.73
	* de-Debianization.  Oh well... ;)
	* no code changes, just like in 0.72

2002-10-13  Michael Tokarev  <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.72

	* cleaned up debian packaging and made it actually work

	* no code changes

2002-07-22  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.71

	* rearranged object files to not depend on ranlib on
	  systems that requires it (i.e. OpenBSD)

	* use ranlib but mark it's possible error as non-fatal

2001-12-10  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.7a

	* converted to CVS, added two missing #include <stdlib.h> for
	  malloc declaration and spec target to the Makefile

2001-10-14  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.7

	* added cdb_seek() and cdb_bread() routines as found
	  in freecdb/cdb-0.64

2001-07-26  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.6

	* added another option, CDB_PUT_WARN, to cdb_make_put's flags
	  (to allow adding unconditionally but still warn about dups),
	  now cdb_make_put seems to be logically complete.

	* added and documented -r and -u options for cdb(1) command,
	  and made them consistent with -w and -e also.

	* reorganized cdb(1) manpage and added changes made to cdb
	  command.

	* added version references to manpages (and make them autogenerated
	  to simplify maintenance).

	* added cdb(5) manpage describing CDB file format.

2001-07-25  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.5

	* added missing #include <sys/types.h> in cdb_init.c, thanks to
	  ppetru@ppetru.net (Petru Paler)

	* removed usage of pread() in cdb_make_find() and friends,
	  suggested by Liviu Daia <Liviu.Daia@imar.ro>

	* autogenerate tinycdb.spec file from template and debian/changelog

	* autogenerate cdb.h from cdb.h.in (substituting version)

2001-06-29  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.4

	* added cdb_make_put() routine to conditionnaly add a record

	* split cdb library to more files (finer granularity)

	* added cdb_findinit() and cdb_findnext() routines

	* renamed cdbtool to cdb

	* simplified cdb utility (dropped various format spec, changed
	  options parsing) and a manpage

	* added small note and copyright to every file in package

	* added some testsuite (make test)

2001-05-27  Michael Tokarev <mjt+cdb@corpit.ru>

	* version 0.3

	* Initial Release.
